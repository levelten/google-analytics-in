Connects Google Analytics with your WordPress site.

== Description ==
The GAinWP Google Analytics Integration for WordPress plugin easily integrates Google Analytics tracking and dashboard reporting into your website in just minutes.

It was created from the excellent Google Analytics Dashboard for WordPress (GADWP) plugin to maintain a robust, direct Google Analytics integration.

In addition to a set of general Google Analytics stats, in-depth Page reports and in-depth Post reports allow further segmentation of your analytics data, providing performance details for each post or page from your website.

The Google Analytics tracking code is fully customizable through options and hooks, allowing advanced data collection like custom dimensions and events.

== Why this Plugin ==

The [IntelligenceWP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/intelligence) project leverages the GADWP plugin for core Google Analytics integrations.

After the Google Analytics Dashboard for WordPress changed maintainers, users expressed concern over the new auth process proving 3rd party access to Google API keys and analytics data.

GAinWP uses a direct auth process where API keys only reside in your WordPress site so data access is not shared with any 3rd parties.

== Credits ==

This plugin was originally created by [Alin Marcu](https://deconf.com) as the Google Analytics Dashboard for WordPress (GADWP)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the full ga-in directory into your wp-content/plugins directory.
2. In WordPress select Plugins from your sidebar menu and activate the GAINWP - Google Analytics Integration for WordPress plugin.

4. Authorize the plugin to connect to Google Analytics using the Authorize Plugin button.

== Frequently Asked Questions == 

= Do I have to insert the Google Analytics tracking code manually? =

No, once the plugin is authorized and a default domain is selected the Google Analytics tracking code is automatically inserted in all webpages.

= Some settings are missing in the video tutorial =

We are constantly improving GAinWP, sometimes the video tutorial may be a little outdated.
